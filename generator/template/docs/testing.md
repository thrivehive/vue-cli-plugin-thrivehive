# Tests

This project uses [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) for unit testing.

Tests may be included anywhere in the project, as long as they are named `<name>.spec.js`.
To ensure that code is testable, anything that can be written as a pure function, should be.

Run all unit tests:

```bash
npm run test
```
